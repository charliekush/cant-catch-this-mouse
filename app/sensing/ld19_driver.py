"""Thin wrapper over lds2d's driver for the LDRobot LD19.

lds2d (https://pypi.org/project/lds2d/, Apache-2.0) is a maintained,
plain-pyserial Python port of the kaiaai/LDS C++ library. Its LDROBOT-LD19
driver parses the 47-byte, 0x54-header, 12-points-per-packet protocol
directly (angle in centidegrees, distance in mm, CRC8-validated), ported
from LDRobot's own reference source. This was chosen over hand-rolling a
parser per the project's stated preference for a maintained implementation.

Caveat worth knowing: lds2d's own README marks LD19 support "spec" rather
than hardware-verified -- it's ported from kaiaai/LDS and unit-tested
against synthetic packets, but not yet confirmed against a physical LD19 by
lds2d's maintainers. Validate this wrapper's output against a known object
with scripts/lidar_viz.py before trusting it for navigation.

Angle convention: degrees, 0 = the LiDAR's forward axis, CCW positive.
lds2d's ScanPoint.angle_deg is 0-360, increasing in the sensor's own scan
direction
